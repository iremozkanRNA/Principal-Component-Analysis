# Principal-Component-Analysis
Performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on gene expression count data generated by `featureCounts`. It processes multiple `.txt` files from a specified directory, merges the data, and generates an interactive PCA plot using the `DESeq2` and `plotly` libraries. The resulting plot is saved as an HTML file for easy sharing and visualization.
